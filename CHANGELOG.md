# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `run.bat` loads `.env` from the service folder for a local run: it passes `--dotenv`, the service prints which variable names it loaded (never the values), and a real environment variable still wins. A plain `uv run python -m src.run`, Docker and the tests never read `.env`. Lens now reads `.env` the same way (new dependency python-dotenv).
- Untracked folders now start with `.` or `_`: `zip_versions/` is `_zip_versions/`. A local `voices`, `tem_code` or `zip_versions` folder from an older checkout needs renaming by hand.
- `run.bat` is now a menu (run the service, deploy, build the release ZIP) and `run.bat run|deploy|zip` skips it. `tools/deploy.bat`, `tools/make_zip.bat` and `tools/deploy.local.example.bat` are gone; the local deploy target is `tools/deploy.local.ini` (copy `tools/deploy.local.example.ini`).
- Admin page: **Connect to this service** card with the addresses other services can use (this page's address, same PC, Docker network, `host.docker.internal`) and every endpoint, each with a Copy button.
- Recognition runs on a TesseractModel service saved on the admin page; Lens keeps region cutting, preprocessing, uploads, jobs, quota and its result cache.
- Admin Settings: restart-applied Data folder.
